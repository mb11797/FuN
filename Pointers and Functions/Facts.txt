“void pointer” 
A void pointer is nothing but a pointer variable declared using the reserved word in C ‘void’. 

Ex:-   void  *ptr; // Now ptr is a general purpose pointer variable

When a pointer variable is declared using keyword void – it becomes a general purpose pointer variable. Address of any variable of any data type (char, int, float etc.)can be assigned to a void pointer variable.

Another important point you should keep in mind about void pointers is that – pointer arithmetic can not be performed in a void pointer. 

Example:- 

void *ptr;

int a;

ptr=&a;

ptr++; // This statement is invalid and will result in an error because 'ptr' is a void pointer variable.
